# New Tumblr Theme - Happy 2014

Created: Decemeber 29, 2013

Happy 2014 is a responsive theme created by [Katie Harron](http://www.twitter.com/pibby). It features mobile navigation for small screens, lazy loading of images, responsive images and photosets, responsive videos, a plethora of social icons, and much more. A current preview of the theme is available on my Tumblr blog at [http://www.pibby.com](http://www.pibby.com). I hope you enjoy it and/or find it useful if you're trying to build your own theme. [The source code is available on Github](https://github.com/pibby/tumblr-theme-happy-2014/blob/master/tumblr.html).

This theme is **free** for personal use and can be modified with your own custom CSS. All I ask is that you keep the link back to my blog in the footer and do not claim the code as your own.
